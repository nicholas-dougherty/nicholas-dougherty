### Hello there, Git crowd! :feelsgood:
***
In early 2022 I pursued a data scientist career
by moving to San Antonio, TX, to participate in Codeup's Data Science bootcamp.
***
Via the Department of Veterans Affairs excellent Veteran Employment Through Technology Education
Courses (VET TEC) program, I shall learn: Applied Statistics, SQL, Regression, Classification, Time Series Analysis, Anomaly Detection, Natural Language
Processing, Distributed Machine Learning, Storytelling with Data, and my new love language, Python. ðŸ«€ [^1] 

[^1]: Love languages were conceptualized a year before I was born. Among those five 'languages,' _acts of service_ had resonated the most.
__UNTIL__ I started learning Python. Python is now my language of love. 

   Prior to this pursuit, I've worn a handful of hats. The most memorable were as an Intelligence Specialist and Geopolitical Analyst. 
Outside of information technology, my passions are nested in literature, music, and nature.
